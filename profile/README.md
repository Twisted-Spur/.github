### What does Github have anything to do with this?
This github organization owner, Gerrid Rose, is the son in law of the actual company owner of Twisted Spur.  He saw an opportunity to further his development skills by working on an e-commerce site for Twisted Spur, whether it ever got to production or not, it would at least be a good experience builder, starting this work during my second child's birth while on paternity leave.  Working in the defense industry, all of my work is hidden from potential recruiters and other companies I may eventually apply for and want to be able to at least offer a snippet of how I work.
